# TeamleaderCodeTest

## Prerequisites

- Node 18 or higher

## Commands

> **_NOTE:_** Dont forget `npm i` to run the application, and `npx playwright install` if you want to run e2e tests

Following commands are handy to check the project:

`npm run start` Starts the development server\
`npm run test` Runs the unit tests (I only added some tests for the order service -> order.service.ts, the rest are standard boilerplate ones)\
`npm run e2e` Runs a e2e test in headless (Added one, places an order and checks the confirmation message)
